# Ideas for LLM Integration in Portfolio Tracker

This document outlines possible features and integration patterns for using a Large Language Model (LLM) within the Portfolio Tracker project. The goal is to enhance user experience, automate workflows, and provide intelligent insights while maintaining modularity and clean architecture.

---

## 1. Natural Language Querying

- **Description:** Allow users to ask questions about their portfolio in plain English.
- **Examples:**
  - "What were my top 5 performing stocks last quarter?"
  - "Summarize my trading activity for May."
- **Integration:** LLM parses the query, maps it to data operations, and returns results.

## 1a. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Portfolio History

- **Description:** Use a RAG system to enable the LLM to answer questions and generate insights based on a user's actual portfolio history, not just pre-trained knowledge.
- **Benefits:**
  - Contextual, personalized answers using up-to-date portfolio data.
  - Scalable retrieval of relevant transactions, summaries, or notes as portfolio history grows.
  - Increased transparency and trust by showing which data was used to generate answers.
  - Enables rich, data-backed queries (e.g., "What was my largest loss in 2023?", "Summarize my options trades last quarter.")
- **How it works:**
  1. Index portfolio data (transactions, positions, notes, reports) for retrieval.
  2. User asks a question in natural language.
  3. Retriever fetches the most relevant portfolio entries or summaries.
  4. LLM uses the retrieved data as context to generate a tailored, accurate response.
- **Implementation:**
  - Use vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone) or keyword search for retrieval.
  - Store portfolio events, notes, and reports as retrievable documents.
  - Integrate the retriever and LLM in your agent workflow.
  - Ensure privacy and security of user data.

## 1b. Local/Browser LLMs for Intent Detection and Escalation

- **Description:** Use small, efficient LLMs running locally in the browser (e.g., via WebLLM, WebAI, or Transformers.js) to handle basic language understanding, intent classification, and simple processing. These models can determine whether a user request can be handled locally or should be escalated to a more powerful cloud LLM (like OpenAI or Gemini).
- **Benefits:**
  - Instant, private responses for simple or routine queries.
  - Reduces cloud API usage and cost by filtering requests.
  - Enables offline and privacy-preserving features.
- **Limitations:**
  - Local models are limited in size and capability compared to cloud LLMs.
  - Best for intent detection, routing, and simple Q&A or summarization.
- **How it works:**
  1. User submits a request in the browser.
  2. Local LLM classifies the request and attempts to answer if possible.
  3. If the request is too complex, the local LLM escalates it to a cloud LLM for advanced processing.
  4. Optionally, the local LLM can pre-process or summarize data before escalation.
- **Example Workflow:**
  - "Show my balance" → handled locally.
  - "Compare my portfolio to S&P 500 over 5 years" → escalated to cloud.

## 2. CSV/Report Summarization

- **Description:** Automatically generate human-readable summaries of imported CSVs or broker activity reports.
- **Examples:**
  - "Summarize my IBKR activity for Q1 2025."
  - "Highlight any unusual transactions."
- **Integration:** LLM processes parsed data and generates a summary section in Markdown reports.

---

## 3. Data Cleaning & Normalization

- **Description:** Use LLM to suggest or perform normalization of inconsistent or ambiguous data fields.
- **Examples:**
  - Mapping broker-specific terms to internal schema.
  - Identifying and correcting data anomalies.
- **Integration:** LLM suggests mappings or corrections, optionally with user approval.

---

## 4. Explanation & Education

- **Description:** Provide user-friendly explanations of financial terms, portfolio metrics, or errors.
- **Examples:**
  - "Explain what 'unrealized gain' means."
  - "Why did this transaction fail compliance checks?"
- **Integration:** LLM generates explanations or tooltips in the UI or reports.

---

## 5. Rule Generation or Validation

- **Description:** LLM helps generate or validate business rules (e.g., compliance, risk).
- **Examples:**
  - "Create a rule to flag trades over $10,000."
  - "Explain why a transaction violates a rule."
- **Integration:** LLM generates code snippets or Prolog rules, or explains rule logic.

---

## 6. Automated Documentation

- **Description:** Generate or update Markdown documentation for new modules, data formats, or workflows.
- **Examples:**
  - "Document the new CSV parsing module."
  - "Summarize changes in the latest release."
- **Integration:** LLM drafts or updates docs in the `docs/` folder.

---

## 7. Interactive Report Generation

- **Description:** LLM assembles Markdown reports with narrative, tables, and SVG charts.
- **Examples:**
  - "Generate a weekly performance report with charts."
- **Integration:** LLM calls tools to generate SVGs, then embeds them in Markdown.

---

## 8. Conversational Assistant

- **Description:** An agent-like assistant that guides users, answers questions, and performs actions.
- **Examples:**
  - "How do I import a new CSV?"
  - "Show me a chart of my portfolio value."
- **Integration:** LLM acts as the interface, calling backend tools as needed.

### Interface Ideas

- **Rich Text Editor:**  
  The assistant is embedded in a rich text editor interface, allowing users to interact conversationally and compose or edit reports directly.
- **Visual Linking:**  
  Users can insert and link visuals (such as SVG charts generated by the agent) directly into the document, making reports interactive and visually rich.
- **Interactive Elements:**  
  Users can click on visuals or highlighted terms to get explanations, drill down into data, or trigger further analysis.
