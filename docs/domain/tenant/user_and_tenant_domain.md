# User and Tenant Domain Relationship

In this domain, the relationship between users and tenants is defined as:

- **Many Users to One Tenant**: Each user belongs to exactly one tenant, and each tenant can have multiple users. This is a one-to-many relationship (Tenant 1â€”* User).

This model is suitable for scenarios where users are isolated by organization or logical grouping, and do not need to belong to multiple tenants.
